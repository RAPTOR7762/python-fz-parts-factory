## About these Python scripts

This is an improved version of the [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org) Parts Factory that generate parts such as coloured headers and multi row headers. These scripts use the `PySide6` library to work with Qt, so for those who don't have C++/Qt coding skills, you can contribute to tgis repo. The scripts are written in Python!

### Installing the scripts

#### Windows (Python Interpreter)

In command prompt (assuming you have installed python and added it to path!), run

```bash
pip install PySide6
```

With the PySide6 library installed, cd to the location where you have stored the scripts, and run

```
python partsfactory.py
```

You need to change the parameters

```python

```
